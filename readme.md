### Pseudo Classes

- [:active psuedo class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active): represents an element (like a button) being "activated" by a user. Typically starts on user click.

### Media Queries

- always place media queries at the bottom so that they can overwrite anything else throughout code
